                <h5>Cyber crime</h5>
                <p>Some of the cyber risks faced by colleges and universities are a product of unique COVID-era circumstances. Higher education institutions were forced to rapidly build out their digital infrastructure to ensure continuity of learning and working amid the pandemic. While this was necessary, it also created new entry points for cybercriminals to leverage malware and other malicious tactics to extract data, force ransom payments and wreak havoc.</p></br>

                <h5>Blind Student Education</h5>
                <p>The average classroom is designed for fully sighted students. But according to the CDC, nearly 3% of children under the age of 18 are blind or visually impaired. Some of these children attend schools that specifically teach blind students, but others enroll in their local public or private schools. As a teacher, you may wonder how to accommodate these students to give them the best chance to succeed. That’s why we’ve asked some experts to offer practical tips you can use every day for teaching blind or visually impaired students</p>
